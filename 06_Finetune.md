# Chapter 6: Finetuning
 - random over grid search
 - hyper-parameter optimization
	 - random experiments are more efficient than grid experiments for hyper-parameter optimization
	 - To investigate the effect of one hyper-parameter of interest X, we recommend random search (instead of grid search) for optimizing over other hyper-parameters. Choose one set of random values for these remaining hyper-parameters and use that same set for each value of X.
