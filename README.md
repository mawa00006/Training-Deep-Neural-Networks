# Training Deep Neural Networks: A Step-by-Step Guide
Workflows, Tips, Tricks, and Techniques for Training Deep Neural Networks

---
### With this project, I want to create an in-depth practical guide for training Deep Neural Networks.

The first draft is inspired by Andrej Karpathy's blog post [A Recipe for Training Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/), but there is much more to cover. The main topics I want to dive into are:
  - DL project management
  - Optimized training procedures
  - State-of-the-Art Deep Learning practices
  - MLOps

This project aims to create a knowledge base that covers each step of a Deep Learning project, but it will also be a journey for me to learn more about DL. I am happy if anybody is interested in joining/helping me. Feel free to start a pull request, or get in contact with me via email.
