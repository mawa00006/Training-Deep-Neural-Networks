# Chapter 5: Regularization
  - try to get more data
	- data augmentation (half-fake data, agressive augmentation)
	- creative augmentation (fake data, GANs, domain randomization, simulation)
	- pretraining
	- smaller input dimensionality (remove features that may contain spurious signals)
	- decrease batch size 
	- dropout
	- weight decay
	- early stopping
	- larger model +early stopping ?
	- visualize the networks first layer weights (if noisy, something could be off)
